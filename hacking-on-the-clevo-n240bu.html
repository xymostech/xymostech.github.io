        I recently bought a new computer,
        the <a href="http://www.clevo.com.tw/clevo_prodetail.asp?id=815&lang=en">Clevo
        N240BU</a>. You might have never heard of Clevo computers (or at least
        I never had) but you've probably seen some of their computers rebranded
        and sold under other name like Sager or System76. In fact, the way I
        found out about their computers was by looking for specs for a System76
        laptop. I'm gonna walk through the process I went through of deciding
        to buy one of these laptops and maybe some helpful tips for anyone else
        who wants to do something similar.
      </p>
      <p>
        To a person like me,
        the <a href="https://system76.com/laptops/lemur">System76 Lemur</a> is
        a pretty sweet looking laptop. It's pretty small (14" screen, less than
        1" thick), can boast an i7 processor and 32 gigs of RAM, and comes with
        Ubuntu preinstalled. My current laptop,
        a <a href="http://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/productdetails/xps-13-9343-laptop">Dell
        XPS 13</a>, has a really wonderful build quality but it's really
        expensive to get one with more RAM and if you want an i7 and more RAM
        it's also gonna come with a touch screen, which I would rather not pay
        for. So, the Lemur has exactly what I want: tons of ram and a fast
        processor for pretty cheap and with a standard 1080p screen. Awesome.
      </p>
      <p>
        But could I get it cheaper? I'm not afraid of taking apart my laptop,
        so I looked into buying my own memory, hard drive(s), and wireless card
        and installing it myself. A cursory glance around the internet shows
        that if I bought the cheap model and put my own RAM, SSD, and wifi
        card, I could make a computer for about $100 cheaper than what I could
        get on System76. I run Arch Linux so having Ubuntu preinstalled isn't
        helpful since I would have to do my own install anyway. This was
        sounding great in theory but I know I've been bitten recently by
        laptops that come with the RAM and SSD soldered to the motherboard. So
        I started doing some research about whether the System76 Lemur could be
        upgraded. And what did I find?
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Nothing.</b> Actually, as far as I can tell, spec sheets for the
        System76 Lemur can't be found.
        The <a href="https://system76.com/guides/lemu7">Lemur Quick Start
        Guide</a> is about as close as I could find to a manual or guide but it
        just comes with some outside shots of the computer and a list of the
        tech specs. Odd. Why would a company devoted to making computers for
        hackers (I guess they're trying to make Linux computers which are
        accessible to non-techy folks, but we all know that people buying Linux
        computers are more likely to be able to take apart their computers) not
        provide any documentation? With some more searching I eventually
        stumbled upon the name of a Taiwanese computer company named "Clevo"
        which led me to their website which led me to the discovery of the
        N240BU.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the most part, this made things click for me. System76 doesn't seem
        like a large enough organization to be actually manufacturing laptops
        from scratch so it makes sense that they're just rebranding a different
        company's laptop. The value they provide is in making sure all of the
        parts actually work with Linux and doing the Ubuntu pre-install. That
        also maybe explains why the computer has such an odd selection of ports
        (who needs a VGA port on their laptop? Or an Ethernet port? Actually an
        Ethernet port sounds pretty handy sometimes) instead of trying to go
        the Mac-esque direction with everything being sleek. And lastly, it
        explains why there are no product manuals for the Lemur: I was
        searching for the wrong product!
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, it sorta explains that last point. It probably wouldn't be
        <i>too</i> hard for System76 to provide a link to the real product
        manuals on their website. Maybe they don't want people finding out the
        truth about their computers (which isn't that big of a deal). Or maybe
        it's because even with the correct product ID, there still aren't very
        good manuals for this computer! The downloads section on the Clevo
        website gives you something, but it's only long because it's translated
        into a million languages. The only shot of the inside is when they show
        you where to put your SIM card in case you get the optional 3G chip.
        Would it kill you to make a repair guide for how to access the
        different parts? Was this a sign that the parts actually weren't
        replaceable, which is why they don't bother telling you how to open the
        thing up?
      </p>
      <p>
        So finding out this hidden secret wasn't helping out with figuring out
        whether I can upgrade the parts myself. Maybe it could help in a
        different way? Thus, I stumbled upon
        <a href="http://rjtech.com">R&amp;J Tech</a>, which sells barebone
        Clevo laptops, including our favourite
        <a href="http://rjtech.com/shop/index.php?dispatch=products.view&product_id=30409">Clevo
        N240BU</a>, without RAM, hard drives, Wi-Fi cards, or an OS! Leaving
        those out drops the price of the laptop down another $150, making this
        look like an even better option. And the fact that
        they're <i>selling</i> these computers provides some pretty good
        evidence that the end consumer would be able to plug in their own
        parts.
      </p>
      <p>
        But pretty good doesn't mean that it's 100% likely. So what's the
        solution in this case? It's pretty obvious: buy the cheap laptop and
        find out for myself if I can replace the parts. Then, armed with my new
        knowledge, take a whole bunch of pictures and post about it on the
        internet! And if it doesn't work out, and the weird barebone computer
        doesn't actually let me put anything in it, then it'll be extra funny.
        Plus, there's a return policy.
